description=Breaking a network into segments while removing stubs and reading unlinks

about=  This tool takes a line-based network. It explodes polylines in the network and breaks them based on their intersection with other lines. Lines that cross other lines can be an unwanted stub. These stubs are removed based on a specified ratio. Optionally, a point or polygon based unlink layer can be specified which highlight crossing lines which should not break. The search area around the unlink features is specified by the unlink buffer variable.This plugin was developed by Space Syntax Open Digital Works Â© 2016 Space Syntax Ltd
